# Classification-vs-Clustering-Ways-for-Diabetes-Detection
**Aim:** Comparatively analysing the efficiency of classification and clustering algorithms for diabetes detection
**Steps**
* Exploring Dataset
* Droping columns which are not required
* Checking for null values
* Upscalling dataset - Incase of pima indiana
* X and Y split
* Countplot for the datasets
* t-SNE plot for the datasets to see the spread
* Scalling the dataset
* Train and test split of the model
* Training classification models
* Training clustering models
* Comparing their performance

**Conclusion**
* Standard machine learning and boosting algorithms were deployed
* XGBoost gave the best performance on both datasets for classification models
* Agglomerative clustering gave the best perfromance on both datasets for clustering models
* Over all XGBoost was better, making classification models more efficient on the datasets
